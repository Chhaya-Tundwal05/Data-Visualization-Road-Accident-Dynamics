# Data-Visualization-Road-Accident-Dynamics
By utilizing datasets from the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police, this project aims to uncover the key causes of accidents in Montgomery County, explore the complex factors contributing to these incidents, and provide actionable insights to help reduce the frequency and severity of accidents. To achieve this, the following questions need to be addressed:

1. Crash Patterns and Trends:
● What are the crash hotspots and peak times in Montgomery County?
● How do accident trends vary across different locations and times of day?
2. Severity of Accidents:
● What is the annual breakdown of crash severity from 2021 to 2024?
● How has the severity of accidents changed over the years?
3. Relationship with Traffic Violations:
● Is there a correlation between road crashes and traffic violations in Montgomery?
● What trends can we expect in the relationship between traffic violations and accidents in
the upcoming years?
4. Key Causes of Accidents:
● What are the primary causes of accidents in Montgomery County, such as driver distraction, substance abuse, and others?
● How can each of these causes be addressed to prevent future accidents?
● What interventions could be implemented to mitigate these risk factors?

The analysis will support data-driven decision-making for policymakers, urban planners, and the public, facilitating the implementation of targeted interventions. These interventions could range from infrastructure improvements (such as better signage or road design) to enhanced law enforcement strategies. Ultimately, this study aims to reduce road accidents' economic and human toll, making Montgomery County’s roadways safer for all. We want to clarify that accidents are not accidental, and they will continue to happen at similar rates every year. There are a lot of factors we cannot control. In this analysis, we want to focus on the factors we can control.
